# Instructions:
# Deploy this file from the AKV Secret 'sealed-secrets-key' directly to the cluster
# Base64 decode the secret and create a sealed-secrets-key.yaml file
# `kubectl apply -f sealed-secrets-key` into the kube-system namespace
# before installing the Sealed Secrets Zarf Package
#
# Other dependencies:
# Sealed secrets will need the `kube-prometheus-stack` deployed first if
# the ServiceMonitor is enabled since it depends on these CRDs. This is
# currently commented out in the values.yaml file.
